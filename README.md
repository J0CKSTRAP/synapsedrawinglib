# Usage
To use this you first have to initialize like below:

```lua
   loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/J0CKSTRAP/synapsedrawinglib/refs/heads/main/Drawing.lua",true))()
```

After initializing the Drawing Library you can use Drawing functions as you normally would
if you don't know how to use the Drawing Library I recommend you use the documentation below:
